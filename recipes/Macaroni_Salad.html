    <h2>Descriptiom</h2>
    
    <p>Macaroni salad is a classic, creamy side dish made with cooked elbow macaroni, fresh vegetables like carrots and bell peppers, and a tangy mayonnaise-based dressing. It’s a refreshing and satisfying dish that’s perfect for picnics, barbecues, or a light lunch. Chilled and flavorful, it combines texture and taste in every bite.</p>
    <p>What makes macaroni salad so versatile is how easily it can be customized to suit different tastes. You can add diced eggs, pickles, shredded chicken, or even cheese for extra richness and protein. The balance of creamy dressing with the crunch of vegetables makes it both comforting and refreshing. Served cold, it's not just easy to prepare but also a great make-ahead dish for gatherings or everyday meals.</p>
